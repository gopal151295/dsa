some basic formulas to remember

sum of natural
1+2+3+4+..n = n*(n+1)/2

sum of square of natural
1+4+9+14+ = [n(n+1)(2n+1)]/6

Sum of Cube of ‘n’ natural numbers
[n(n+1)/2] ^ 2

sum of GP
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16... = a(r^n - 1)/(r-1)

if r < 1 and n-> infinity
sum = a/(1-r)

log(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ...

log(m*n) = log(m) + log(n)
